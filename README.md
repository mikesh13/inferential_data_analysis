# inferential_data_analysis

This repo contains the codes I wrote for the assignments and team project using RStudio.
The same [dataset](https://github.com/mikesh13/inferential_data_analysis/blob/master/HW3/Class_Survey_W20.csv) is used for every assignment.
For every assignments, I needed to think of a research question, indicated a dependent variable and several independent variables in the model, 
why I chose these variables, and did descriptive statistics for the variables to introduce them to readers.

[HW3](https://github.com/mikesh13/inferential_data_analysis/blob/master/HW3) is for data visualization practices.

[HW4](https://github.com/mikesh13/inferential_data_analysis/blob/master/HW4) is for linear regression model.

[HW5](https://github.com/mikesh13/inferential_data_analysis/blob/master/HW5) is for logistic regression model.

[HW6](https://github.com/mikesh13/inferential_data_analysis/blob/master/HW6) is for ordered logit regression model.

[HW7](https://github.com/mikesh13/inferential_data_analysis/blob/master/HW7) is for poisson model and negative binomial model 
and to choose one of them based on the research question and the variable I selected.

[HW8](https://github.com/mikesh13/inferential_data_analysis/blob/master/HW8) is for principal component analysis and factor analysis.

The [project](https://github.com/mikesh13/inferential_data_analysis/blob/master/Project) is find 
what financial indicators impact the ratio of research to development expense and operating income.
The dataset is retrieved from Kaggle
